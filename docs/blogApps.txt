```python
from django.apps import AppConfig
```

This line imports the `AppConfig` class from the `django.apps` module. `AppConfig` is a base class used for configuring Django applications.

```python
class BlogConfig(AppConfig):
```

This line defines a new class named `BlogConfig`, which will be the configuration for the 'blog' app.

```python
    default_auto_field = 'django.db.models.BigAutoField'
```

This line sets the `default_auto_field` attribute of the `BlogConfig` class to `'django.db.models.BigAutoField'`. This attribute defines the default primary key type for models in the app.

```python
    name = 'blog'
```

This line sets the `name` attribute of the `BlogConfig` class to `'blog'`. The `name` attribute should match the name of the app directory.

```python
    def ready(self):
```

This line defines the `ready` method inside the `BlogConfig` class. The `ready` method is called as soon as the app registry is fully populated, which means that all the apps in the project have been imported and registered.

```python
        import blog.signals
```

This line imports the `blog.signals` module. The purpose of this import is to ensure that the signals defined in the `blog.signals` module are connected and will be triggered when certain events occur.

In summary, the `BlogConfig` class is used to configure the 'blog' app in the Django project. It sets the default primary key type for models and imports the `blog.signals` module to ensure the signals are connected and ready to be used. The `ready` method is a hook provided by Django to perform any necessary setup or initialization when the app is ready to be used.
